The script provides statistical information on the most popular times of travel, stations, trip durations, and user information based on the user's input for city, month, and day of the week.

### Files used
The script expects those data files:

* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

To execute the script, you need to run:

* bikeshare.py

### Credits
